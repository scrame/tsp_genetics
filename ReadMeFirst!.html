<p>I apologize in advance for the awkward interface and default values. I wrote this to step you through the most basic operations of the program, but I have not changed anything since it was originally written. At the end of this document I briefly discuss the various problems with the program from the initial design to the final user experience. </p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is rename 'tspGenetics.ba' to 'tspGenetics.bat'. If you are not on a windows system, you can run it from the command line:</p>
<pre>java -cp tspGenetics.jar MainClass </pre>
<p>On a windows system with Java installed, double clicking the
  tspGenetics.bat file should start the program, opening the main window
  (mainScreen.jpg):</p><br/>

  <br/>
  On my system this works with Java 1.4, but was initially written for
  Java 1.2.<br/>
  <br/>
  Enter '10000' in the 'Number of Generations' box.<br/>
  <br/>
  Clicking the 'help' button will open a new window containing a text
  file with a brief background of the problem and some of the underlying
  theory. The 'map' button will give a few simple options relating to the
  number of cities and the size (in pixels) of the map. The default is 30
  cities, which has somewhere near 2.6525285981219105863630848e+32
  possible solutions (according to my handy calculator), which is a
  fairly large problem area. Unfortunately, there is no mathematical
  formula to determine the optimal path through the cities.&nbsp; This
  program uses genetic algorithms to determine which path is the best.<br/>
  <br/>
  Click 'configure'. The following window should appear (configure.jpg):<br/>
  <br/>

 alt="TSP Genetics Configuration Panel" /><br/>
  <br/>
  Click the 'Unary Cycle' button until 'Random Splice' appears (I know,
  its awkward), and then click 'Binary Cycle' until 'Edge Recombination'
  appears. Click 'Set Types'. Note that the window will NOT close.<br/>
  <br/>
  In the main control panel, click 'GO!', the following window will
  appear (progress.jpg):<br/>
  <br/>
  <img src="images/progress.JPG"
 alt="TSPGenetics Data Generation Window" /><br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is the main loop of the program. The progress bar displays the
  percentage of the total generations that have been processed. The
  underlying mechanics are beyond the scope of this document. It is not
  necessary to let the process run completely, but the longer it runs,
  the better the result. The Unary and Binary algorithms selected earlier
  make an effective combination, and in my own runs, they almost always
  provide the optimal solution within 10,000 generations (meaning less
  than 2.4e+5 calculations, vs 2.6e+32 calculations required by brute
  force). The tour lengths are measured with a simple Euclidean metric,
  and represent the number of units (pixels) required to draw that tour.
  The lower the number the better the result.<br/>
  <br/>
  The numbers are the average and best solutions for that generation<br/>
  <br/>
  Regardless of whether the loop reaches the end, or the user hits the
  stop button, the following two windows will be opened (comparison.jpg
  and bestTour.jpg):<br/>
  <br/>
  <img
 src="images/comparison.JPG"
 alt="TSPGenetics Average/Best Comparison" /><br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <img src="images/bestTour.JPG"
 alt="TSPGenetics Best Tour Window" /><br/>
  <br/>
  The first window is a (unfortunately unlabeled) graph of the lengths of
  the tours over each generation. When the algorithms used are effective,
  the graph should be similar to this, and the average and best tours
  should be tied closely together. Ineffective combinations will result
  in either constant or random graphs. Generally, the upper bound on
  these settings is around 5000 and the ideal is usually around 1200.<br/>
  <br/>
  The second window will display a brief animation of the best tour
  through each generation. The best solution should trace an outline
  around the cities and should not have any crossed lines. There is
  currently no way to replay this animation. It might also be necessary
  to resize the window to view the map properly.<br/>
  <br/>
  There are many algorithms and options that can be used, and despite the
  rough user interface, this program gives a visual comparison of several
  common types of genetic algorithms, and often subtle changes can
  produce dramatically different results.<br/>
  <br/>
  The code itself is in the tspGeneticsSource folder.<br/>
  <br/>
  Please keep in mind that this code has been untouched for nearly&nbsp; five years, and there are quite a few details that I would do
  differently now:<br/>
  <ul>
  <li>Replace 'Your Product Name' in the comments with TSPGenetics.</li>
  <li> Clean up the user interface (obviously, drop down boxes should be
  used instead of buttons, I still don't know why I did that).</li>
  <li> Display the map and make it editable.</li>
  <li> Add a button to replay the animation</li>
  <li> Display the best tour progression as the data is generated instead
  of afterwards.</li>
  <li> Add labels and values to the graph.</li>
  <li> The animation window size should be properly set.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  Additionally, there are a few extra features in the original design
  that never made the final cut, and they can be found in the
  'surgicallyRemoved' sub folder.<br/>
  <br/>
  Beyond this, there are a few serious code/design problems as well, the
  following should be changed:<br/>
  <ul>
  <li> The program should be deployed with a platform-independent executeable JAR. </li>
  <li> All of the code is currently in the default package. It should be in
  its own package.</li>
  <li> Similarly, functional groups should be placed into appropriate sub
  packages, for example, the binary and unary operators should be in
  separate folders -- during development, I used main() functions to test
  each class. While effective, it makes maintenance confusing. Now, I
  would use JUnit and create separate unit testing classes according to
  the test first methodology.</li>
  <li> The headers and comments are not Javadoc compliant. They were
  generated from a template by an early version of JBuilder. The
  flexibility of Java makes it easy to write self-documenting code, and
  compliance with Sun's standards make it easy to create and maintain API
  documentation.</li>
  <li> Much of the design was ad-hoc. While I had a clear idea of the
  program, and developed it through top down decomposition, I worked many
  complicated and unnecessary features in the beginning, which were
  ultimately removed, but cost me time which would have helped smooth
  the&nbsp; interface problems.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The final project included a project notebook containing all of my
  research and design notes, which included much more information about
  the mathematics behind the algorithms and comparisons of internal
  representations, as well as various other pieces of background image.
  This notebook is (hopefully)&nbsp; in the computer science department
  library at the University of Redlands, and was intended to be this
  programs accompanying documentation, which is why the documents here
  were so sparse (and necessitating this document).<br/>
  <br/>
  Finally, I would like to note a few of the actual implementation
  details:<br/>
  The map loading and saving used Java's Serializable interface; the GUI
  is done with Java's swing lightweight component library; and the graph
  and animation windows are independent threads created by implementing
  the Runnable interface.<br/>
  <br/>
  Again, I apologize for the delay in sending this, but in reviewing the
  layout, there were many glaring issues that I feel would create
  unnecessary doubts of my competence based on mistakes made several
  years ago. I hope you can overlook these issues as you examine the
  code, as my methodologies have grown considerably.<br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks for your patience,<br/>
  <br/>
